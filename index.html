            <p>They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth
              was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and
              pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment
              of the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they
              had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter
              of a mile behind.</p>

            <p>He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself
              not tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much
              might have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk,
              but there seemed to be an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected
              that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale
              with great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her
              patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tete-a-tete
              was over. On Mr. and Mrs. Gardinerâ€™s coming up they were all pressed
              to go into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined,
              and they parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed
              the ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw
              him walking slowly towards the house.</p>
